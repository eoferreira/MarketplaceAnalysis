# Marketplace Analysis

Web scraping of a marketplace (www.icarros.com.br) for analysis on BigQuery. The four main files are the following:

## extract_scraper.py
This script crawls the website and scrapes its data. You can scrape the whole marketplace or filter by any conditions you want. The filtering can be done by setting the filters on the marketplace and copy and pasting the link on this file. The scraped content will be saved as JSON files.

## transform_dump.py
This script will get the JSON files generated by the extract_scraper.py, transform them and dump them together in a single newline delimited JSON that can be easily ingested by BigQuery. You can filter which brands or models you want to be in this new JSON file.

## load_data.py
This script will get the newline limited JSON and upload it to a BigQuery table. You can easily set the BigQuery dataset name, table name (the script will create both for you if they don't exist) and the schema you want. You will need a JSON file with your BigQuery credentials (you can do this by setting up a Service Account on Google Cloud). Once this scripted is executed and your data is loaded, you can start querying it with SQL using other scripts, the BigQuery UI or other solutions.

## Resultados.ipynb
This notebook queries the table on BigQuery to get some info about the data and answer a few questions about the data.

## queries.sql
This SQL file has some queries that were used on the Resultados.ipynb notebook.
